# ETP FIFO Engine — Web App

Upload the Investor Summary Excel file, the engine processes it, and you download the result.

## What it does

**Stage 1 — Supplier Invoice → BOL**
- Allocates supplier invoice gallons to each BOL in Load Tracking sheet order (FIFO per supplier)
- Writes to Purchase to BOL-RTB: Supplier Invoice (col D), Batch (col O), Cost/Gal USD (col J), Total/Liter MXN (col R)
- Writes to Supplier Invoices: Net RTB Gallons (col W), Remainder Gallons (col X), liter formulas (col U, V)

**Stage 2 — RTB → BTC FIFO**
- Builds inventory queue per (product, bulk plant) from RTB Total Cost/L (col AV)
- BTCs draw from queue in sheet order, weighted average when spanning multiple RTBs
- Writes to Load Tracking: Supply Cost (col AR), Batch (col BE), Supplier Invoice (col BF), BOL Source (col BG), Batch Source (col BH)

**FIFO sheet** — Full chronological view with running inventory balance and summary block

**Overall Summary** — Remaining gallons and weighted average cost in inventory per supplier
